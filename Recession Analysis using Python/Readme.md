Recession: Case Study
Recessions are periods of economic contraction having a significant impact on various industries. Typically, a recession is characterized by a significant decline in the gross domestic product (GDP) over a time period, leading to widespread unemployment, loss of income, and reduced business activity.

Here is a dataset of the monthly GDP of the United Kingdom from 2020 to 2022. Below are all the features in the dataset:

Time Period: Monthly time period
GDP Growth: The growth rate of GDP every month
As every decline in the GDP growth rate is not a recession, your task is to identify the months in which the UK faced a recession between 2020-2022.


Observation:
1. GDP growth over time
2. GDP growth and recession over quaterly 
3.Finding deeper economy decline by referring to severity of recession.

Summary:
A recession is an economic situation that arrives when the circulation of money in the economy is low for two consecutive quarters. Recession is calculated and analyzed according to the growth in GDP, the growth in the unemployment rate, and the growth in consumer spending rate.
